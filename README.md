# LevelCheck
This project takes in user input about gender, age, SBP, DBP, and BPM to create the output. Depending on the inputs, the program will refer the user to a website to remedy whatever measurement level is out of the ordinary, while stating the exception that the user is experiencing. In addition, if the program detects that the levels of the user are out of the ordinary and will result in a medical emergency, it scrapes the current location of the user and finds websites about the hospitals closest to the user's current location to ensure that the user is able to see and visit the hospitals near him/her.
